2) Most projects doesen't need react in the initial phase

### why React was creater
1) Becuase of phantom message problem in facebook
2) State was managed by javascript and UI was managed my DOM and there was no sync between them so the team inside the facebook went to solve this problem and comes up with React.js
3) Initial users of React.js was khan Academy and unsplash

## Lecture 2

### React New Documentation is [here](https://react.dev/)

### React is a core library
1) react-dom: it is use to make web apps
2) react-native: it is use to make mobile apps

#### npm: node package manager
#### npx: node package executor

### different ways to create a react app
1) npx create-react-app: old way (not recommended), time consuming and heavy
2) npm create vite@latest: latest way (recommended): fast as vite is french work for quick or fast

### Always open package.json first and try to understand it
1) there is a way to read the project
2) in the production build folder sereved to the user and not the react folder
3) create-react-app is not a good way so we will be using vite (pronounced as veet)
4) dev dependencies dont go to the production, we use it during delevelopement only
5) vite is lighter than CRA (create-react-app)
6) we are going to be inside of src folder almost always
